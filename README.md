# Open Source Knowledge about Longboard Skills with Anatomy 
Open source knowledge of formal analysis of longboarding (long skateboard) techniques so that new comers can easily understand the basics concept and common sense physics to learn the technqiues such as carving, sliding, and, in the future, to cover dancing (not current - but welcome anyone to contribute to add the open source knowledge so that anyone with any age (if personal health condition permitted) to learn the longboarding.
# Demostration
I am not claiming that I am expert in longboarding anything like. Instead, I am using the repository to share with anyone in the world to share finding of techniques in how-to about longboard downhill or freeride styles (for now).
# Techniques - Sliding and Carving
This is still working progress - I will keep adding more materials while I am compiling more technique analysis using phyics to explain the sliding techniques.
- "heel-side" (facing downhill) sliding techniques: the anatomy diagram in the slide (see next paragraph).
- "toe-side (facing uphill)" sliding techniques: TO-BE-Added soon.
- "Carving" techniques: TO-BE-Added soon.
- "Hand-assisted Sliding techniques": TO-BE-Added soon.
- "Mixing Carving and Sliding techniques": TO-BE-Added soon.

# Anatomy of Sliding of Downhild/Freeride Longboarding
- Download the PPTX Slide (still in development and will grow more pages soon) to view the Sliding Anatomy (Please help me to correct the mistake about what I explained in the slide if any. Thanks)
  - ./Longboard-sliding-Anatomy_2020-11-04.pptx
    - For now, I only have "heel-side (facing downhill)" sliding anatomy. I will add "toe-side" and other techniques' anatomy soon.
